As you can see, the folder that holds all the files in this repository is named pa8Submit. This was actually a PA for one of my CSE courses at UCSD.
This assignment was given in order to give an in depth understanding of the Heap data structure. If you would like to reproduce this, simply clone the repository and alter the HeapTest java file to your desire.
